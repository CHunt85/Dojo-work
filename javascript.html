             <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
             <p>Javascript is a cross-platform,object-orented scripting language.Javascripts is expremely popular for a variety of reason.
                 it is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexiblilty for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
                 Javascript lives inside a host enviroment (a web browser or node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments
                 to provide programmatic conrol over them.</p>
            <li> <span> Varitable Declaration</span> Javascript varaibles are containers for storing data vlaues - imagine a cup you fill woth cofee, the cup holds the coffee,
                a variable holds a value. All Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x</li>
            <li><span>Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to Javascript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it,
                giving our variable a value to hold. The = assighnment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10</li>
            <li><span>Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variablee you need to know the data type.
                There are six data types that are javascript primitives: Boolean - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159;
                string - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array - [1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name: 'Jane', last_name; 'Doe'}</li>
            <li><span>Conditionals</span> When you write a code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or condditions that have been met.
                you can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statments: if a specified condition is true, do this in our code block;
                else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we exicute this block of code.</li>
            <li><span>Loops</span> Ther are many kinds of loops in every programming language, but they essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some numbers of times.
                Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. that's a loop!</li>
            <li><span>Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions
                As an example imagine we are putting a desk together from Ikea, we ope up the instruction maunual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table; next we place the table the right way up.
                Done! We finished our instructions.Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
